"""Per-commodity contract specs. The dashboard prices exactly one commodity per session
(see state.py's commodity_code) -- everything that differs by product (contract size,
quoting unit, which months are actually listed futures vs. serial-option-only, a rough
daily-vol estimate for VaR) funnels through the CommoditySpec for that selection instead
of being hardcoded to corn.

`code` is also the raw symbol prefix (e.g. "ZCZ26"'s "ZC") and the prefix used to keep
each commodity's reference data (contract marks, IV snapshot, prior settles) from
colliding in Snowflake, since those tables are keyed by canonical key alone -- see
`reference_key()`. All codes here are exactly 2 characters; that invariant is relied on
wherever a stored key is de-prefixed back to its bare canonical key (state.py).
